## 1. What DHL is

DHL is a central digital ministry hub for foreigners and diaspora communities in Korea. Social media attracts people; DHL gathers them; community connects them; discipleship develops them; leadership training equips them; mission sends them; and leaders multiply.

The site is built around one idea: **visitors should never get lost.** Every page shows:

- **Where am I?** A "You are here" strip under the page title shows the current step of the seven-step journey.
- **What can I learn?** The page's topics, lessons or resources.
- **What should I do next?** A "next step" band at the bottom of every page.
- **How can I connect with someone?** Mentor, community and prayer buttons throughout, plus the "Ask DHL AI" button.

The design uses a **Seoul-metro route map** as its visual language. Foreigners in Korea already know how to read one. The ministry journey is one line with seven stations, and the four pathways are four colored lines. The home page hero shows a verse of the day.

## 3. Run it on your computer

The site loads its content from the `content/` folder, which browsers only allow through a web server. Double-clicking `index.html` shows the page design but no content. To test on your computer, run a small local web server in the project folder:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000. (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`. With VS Code, the "Live Server" extension works too.)

## 4. Upload to GitHub

1. Sign in at github.com and click **New repository**. Name it (for example `dhl`), choose **Public**, and click **Create repository**.
2. Click **uploading an existing file**.
3. Unzip the project, open the folder, select **everything inside it** and drag it into the browser. Folders upload with their contents.
4. Click **Commit changes**.

`index.html` must be at the top level of the repository, not inside another folder. The `.nojekyll` file may be hidden on your computer; the site works without it.

## 5. Turn on GitHub Pages

1. In the repository, open **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Choose branch **main** and folder **/ (root)**, then **Save**.
4. After a minute or two, your address appears, for example `https://your-username.github.io/dhl/`. Then connect your domain (below).

All links are relative, so they work at any address.

### Your domain: www.diasporahubforleaders.com

The site is set up for **www.diasporahubforleaders.com** (registered at Namecheap). The `CNAME` file in the main folder tells GitHub Pages to use this domain. Keep it when you upload files, or GitHub forgets the domain.

- **Namecheap → Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS:** four *A Records* for host `@` (185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153) and a *CNAME Record* for host `www` pointing to `your GitHub username` + `.github.io`.
- **GitHub → repository → Settings → Pages → Custom domain:** `www.diasporahubforleaders.com`, then tick **Enforce HTTPS** once the check is green.
- Keep **Auto-Renew** on in Namecheap so the domain never expires.

The page addresses used for sharing on Facebook (`og:url`, `canonical`), `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and the backend settings already use this domain.

## 6. Connect YouTube

Without a key, the Media page shows the videos in `content/videos.json`. With a key, your newest uploads load automatically.

1. **Channel ID:** YouTube Studio → Settings → Channel → Advanced settings → copy the Channel ID (starts with `UC`).
2. **API key:** at console.cloud.google.com, create a project, enable **YouTube Data API v3**, then go to **Credentials → Create credentials → API key**.
3. **Restrict the key.** This step is essential:
   - Application restrictions → **Websites** → add `https://www.diasporahubforleaders.com/*` and `https://diasporahubforleaders.com/*` (and `http://localhost:8000/*` while testing).
   - API restrictions → **Restrict key** → only **YouTube Data API v3**.
4. In `js/content.js`, paste the key (the DHL channel ID `UCy-688NReUqpEgWUziM2n8A` is already set):
   ```js
   const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "AIzaSy...";
   const YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID = "UCy-688NReUqpEgWUziM2n8A";
   ```

The site reads your channel's uploads playlist, which costs **1 quota unit** per request (search would cost 100). It caches results in the visitor's browser for an hour. If anything fails, it quietly shows the fallback videos.

Videos are sorted into Media page categories (Message, Bible study, Testimony, Life in Korea, Leadership) by words in their titles. Edit the words in `VIDEO_CATEGORY_KEYWORDS` in `js/content.js`.

## 7. Connect Facebook

In `js/content.js`:

```js
const FACEBOOK_PAGE_URL = "https://www.facebook.com/your-page";
```

The site currently uses the share link `https://www.facebook.com/share/1CPwX6C7Hv/`. That works for buttons and links. For the embedded post feed, Facebook needs the Page's real address: open the share link, copy the address that appears in the browser (like `https://www.facebook.com/YourPageName`), and paste it into `FACEBOOK_PAGE_URL`.

**What works automatically:** the Media page uses Facebook's official **Page Plugin** to show your latest public posts. It loads only when a visitor clicks "Show Facebook posts", which keeps the site fast and doesn't share visitors' data with Facebook until they choose. Your Page must be public. Some browsers and privacy extensions block the embed, so a link to your Page is always shown.

**What doesn't, and why:** automatically pulling Facebook posts into the DHL feed would need a Page access token. That is a secret, and it can't be placed in a public website. Until there's a backend, add important Facebook posts to the feed by hand (next section). It takes about a minute each.

Social and community links are in Pages CMS → *Site settings* (`content/site-settings.json`). Empty links are hidden automatically.

## 8. Add ministry posts

**The easy way:** in Pages CMS, open **News & posts**, click **Add an entry** at the top of the list, fill in the form and click **Save** (section 19). The News Admin (section 18) also works.

**By hand:** open `content/posts.json` on GitHub, click the pencil icon, and add a post inside the `"posts"` list:

```json
{
  "type": "announcement",
  "title": "Bible camp registration is open",
  "date": "2026-10-05",
  "description": "Join us for two days of Bible teaching and fellowship this December.",
  "url": "events.html",
  "image": "assets/images/news-bible-camp.jpg",
  "category": "Announcement"
},
```

- `type`: `"announcement"` shows as **News**. Other types: `"event"`, `"testimony"`, `"study"`, `"resource"`, `"youtube"` (add `"videoId"`) and `"facebook"`.
- `date`: always year-month-day. The newest date shows first automatically.
- `"pinned": true` keeps a post at the top. `"sample": true` shows a "Sample" badge.
- For a **full article**, add `"id"` (unique, e.g. `"2026-10-05-bible-camp"`) and `"content"`. The post then opens on `news.html?id=...`. In the content, write `\n\n` between paragraphs, and start a line with `> ` to highlight a Bible verse. Optional `"author"`, `"scripture"` and `"scriptureVersion"` appear at the end of the article.

JSON is strict: every name and text needs "double quotes", items are separated by commas, and there's **no comma after the last item** in a list. If a section of the site goes empty after an edit, the file probably has a typo. Pages CMS avoids this problem entirely.

## 9. Add courses and lessons

All course content is in `content/` and has an edit form in Pages CMS:

- **Academy levels and courses:** *Leadership Academy* (`academy.json`)
- **Gospel Class:** *Gospel Class: topics* and *Gospel Class: beginner course*, plus *Bible studies*
- **Discipleship, Mind Education, Leadership:** their own entries
- **Certificate courses:** *Certificate courses* (`certificate-courses.json`)
- **Pathways and their stations:** `js/content.js`, section 9 (page structure, changed rarely)

**Theological content.** Every Gospel and discipleship summary is marked status "draft" and shows a "Draft for review" badge. Replace the wording with DHL-approved teaching, then change the status to "approved". The drafts only summarize what the listed Bible passages say; they're starting points, not DHL doctrine.

### The learning hub

The site's content is organized into three categories, reached from the **Contents Hub** (`contents.html`):

- **Bible Journey:** Gospel Class, Discipleship Training and Mind Education, then Leadership and Ministry.
- **Live in Korea:** Korean Language Class, Visa, Job, Campus Life, Living in Korea and the Q&A Corner.
- **Certificate Course:** structured courses with a certificate of completion.

**Live in Korea guides** (*Live in Korea: guides* in Pages CMS, `content/korea-guides.json`): each guide has an area (`korean`, `visa`, `job`, `campus` or `living`), a level, reading time, description and optional tips. Add a website link (with optional button text), a page on this site, a certificate course ID, or a form. Tick **Show in "Recommended sites"** to also feature it at the top of the page.

**Q&A Corner** (*Live in Korea: Q&A Corner*, `content/qa.json`): a category, question and answer. Questions from visitors go to the form in *Site settings → Forms → question*.

**Certificate courses** (*Certificate courses*, `content/certificate-courses.json`): each course has modules, each module has lessons (paragraphs, Bible references, reflection questions), then quiz questions. For each quiz question, "Correct option number" counts from 0. Set status to "planned" to show a course as "Coming later". A certificate unlocks when every lesson is marked complete and the quiz score reaches the pass mark.

Progress, quiz scores and certificates are saved in the visitor's browser. Certificates show a reference code but can't be verified online until DHL has a backend with accounts. Every certificate states that it is not an accredited academic qualification.

**Mind Education lessons** (*Mind Education* in Pages CMS) are general study notes based on the Bible passages they list, marked "Draft for review". Replace them with DHL's official Mind Education materials.

**Visa and job guides** are general information, not legal advice, and the site says so. Review them regularly against Hi Korea and other official sources.

## 10. Add events

In Pages CMS, open **Events** and add an entry. By hand, edit `content/events.json`:

```json
{ "title": "Bible camp", "date": "2026-12-26", "startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "17:00",
  "location": "Gapyeong", "category": "Bible Camp",
  "description": "Two days of teaching and fellowship.",
  "registrationUrl": "https://forms.gle/...", "contact": "camp@your-dhl-ministry.org" }
```

Times use 24-hour format. Upcoming events are sorted soonest first. Events whose date has passed move to "Past events" automatically. Categories become filter buttons, and each event gets an "Add to Google Calendar" link.

## 11. How the newest-first feed works

When the home page loads, it takes every entry in `ministryPosts` and adds your newest YouTube uploads (if the API is configured), skipping videos already in your list. It then sorts everything by `date`, newest first. The newest post is shown large, the rest in a grid. Visitors can filter by type and load more. You never rearrange anything by hand.

## 12. How the AI demo works

The "Ask DHL AI" button appears on every page, and `ai-assistant.html` has a full-page version.

In **demo mode** (`AI_CONFIG.enabled: false`, the default), **no AI is used**. The assistant:

1. breaks the question into keywords,
2. searches the DHL content already on the site (topics, lessons, studies, Life in Korea resources and the `assistantFaq` list in `content.js`),
3. shows the best-matching passage **word for word**, with its sources and Bible references,
4. recommends a DHL mentor for theological questions, and whenever nothing matches.

**Writing the assistant's answers.** In Pages CMS, open **AI assistant: knowledge** (`content/ai-knowledge.json`) and add entries. Each has an example question, keywords, the answer, a source type, a source title, and optional Bible references and link. Your entries are checked before the site's general study notes, so when a visitor's question matches, your answer is shown word for word. Untick **Use this answer** to hide an entry without deleting it.

Source types keep the sources separate, as the DHL AI rules require:
- **dhl:** a DHL answer, for practical or general questions.
- **bible:** a Bible study note. Shown as "Bible study note: *source*".
- **park:** Pastor Ock Soo Park's teaching. Used only when someone asks about Pastor Park, and always shown as "Pastor Ock Soo Park's teaching (from *book*)" with a note that it's his explanation, not a quotation from the Bible. Write short summaries in your own words, not long passages from his books, which are copyrighted.

The live AI (section 13) receives the same entries as DHL-approved answers.

Every demo answer is labelled as a DHL study note, not an AI answer. This honestly demonstrates the retrieval half of RAG.

Questions about Rev. Ock Soo Park's teaching get an honest reply: his books aren't in the knowledge base yet, so the assistant says so, shows related Bible passages, and suggests a mentor. It never guesses what he teaches.

**Safety.** Messages mentioning suicide, self-harm, abuse, violence or an emergency skip the search. They get a caring reply with Korean emergency numbers (112, 119, 109 suicide prevention, 1345 multilingual immigration help) and the mentor button. Check these numbers periodically in `koreaHelpNumbers` in `content.js`.

Conversations are not stored anywhere.

## 13. Connecting a real AI/RAG backend later

### The AI assistant

**DHL AI's instructions** are in `ai/dhl-ai-system-prompt.md`: the two sources (the Bible, and Rev. Ock Soo Park's books), answering from Scripture first, keeping the sources clearly separate, never inventing verses or quotations, respecting copyright, answering in the user's language, study mode and safety. Edit that file to change how the live assistant behaves.

**A ready-made backend** is in `backend-example/cloudflare-worker/`, with step-by-step instructions in its README. It loads the prompt from your published site, calls the Claude API with a key stored secretly on Cloudflare, and returns answers in the format below. The Claude API is paid per use, so set a spending limit.

A secure backend (a "proxy") sits between the website and the AI provider:

```
Browser  ──question──▶  Your backend  ──▶  Search approved DHL knowledge base
                              │                    │
                              │◀── relevant passages
                              │
                              ├──▶  AI provider (secret key stored here only)
                              │◀── answer
Browser  ◀── answer + sources ┘
```

1. Build an endpoint, for example `https://api.your-dhl.org/ai/ask`. Serverless platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Functions or Supabase Edge Functions work well and have free tiers (check their current terms).
2. The site sends:
   ```json
   { "question": "What is repentance?", "history": [{ "role": "user", "content": "..." }], "page": "/gospel.html" }
   ```
3. Your endpoint returns:
   ```json
   {
     "answer": "Repentance means...",
     "sources": [{ "title": "DHL Gospel Course, lesson 5", "url": "https://.../gospel.html#course" }],
     "refs": ["Acts 3:19"],
     "needsMentor": false
   }
   ```
4. In `js/content.js`:
   ```js
   const AI_CONFIG = { enabled: true, endpoint: "https://api.your-dhl.org/ai/ask", ... };
   ```

If the endpoint fails, the site falls back to demo search automatically. The safety handling (section 12) stays in the browser either way; add the same checks on the server.

**Building the knowledge base (RAG):**

1. Put **approved** documents in `knowledge/gospel/`, `knowledge/discipleship/` and the other folders. Only use material DHL owns or has written permission to use. Don't upload copyrighted books without permission.
2. On the backend, split documents into short passages and create embeddings (a searchable index).
3. For each question, retrieve the top passages and instruct the model to answer **only** from them, cite them, and set `needsMentor: true` when the passages don't answer the question or the question is personal or sensitive.
4. Return short quotations and summaries, never whole chapters or books.
5. Have DHL leaders review a sample of answers regularly.

The `knowledge/` folder is excluded from search engines in `robots.txt`. Anything in a public GitHub repository is public, though, so keep unpublished or licensed material in a private repository or on the backend instead.

### Accounts, progress and data

Today, pathway and course progress is saved in the visitor's browser only (`DHL.Progress` in `main.js`), and the site says so. To move to accounts:

- Set `CONFIG.backend = { enabled: true, baseUrl: "https://api.your-dhl.org" }`. The site will then request `GET /posts` and `GET /events` (returning the same JSON shapes as the data files), and fall back to local files if the backend is unavailable.
- Replace the four methods of `Progress` (`read`, `write`, `isDone`, `toggle`) with API calls. The pages already use only these methods.
- Planned entities: Users, Profiles, Courses, Lessons, Enrollments, Progress, Groups, Mentors, Disciples, Leaders, Assignments, Certificates, Events, Prayer Requests, Ministry Posts and AI Conversations.

Real sign-in must use a proper authentication service on the backend. The site contains no login and does not pretend to.

## 14. Why API keys must not be exposed

Everything in a GitHub Pages site, including every JavaScript file, can be read by anyone.

- **YouTube browser key: acceptable when restricted.** It reads only public data, and with website and API restrictions it can't be used elsewhere. The worst case is someone using up your free daily quota.
- **AI provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others): never.** Anyone could copy the key and run up charges on your account, or misuse it in your name. That is why `AI_CONFIG` has only an `endpoint`, and the key lives on the backend.
- **Facebook Page tokens, database passwords, service accounts: never.**

If a secret key is ever committed by mistake, **revoke it immediately** in the provider's dashboard. Deleting the file isn't enough, because Git keeps history.

## 15. Replace the demo content

Demo items are marked `sample: true` (posts, events, groups, videos) or `status: "draft"` (topics and lessons), and they show a badge.

1. Replace or delete the sample events, videos and groups (Pages CMS: *Events*, *Media: videos*, *Community groups*).
2. Replace the draft teaching with DHL-approved wording and set `status: "approved"`.
3. Rewrite "Our story" in `about.html`. Don't list partnerships, people or credentials that aren't confirmed.
4. Set every form link in Pages CMS → *Site settings → Forms* to your real Google Forms.
5. When everything is real, set `showDemoLabels: false` in `CONFIG`.

**Forms to create** (Google Forms is free): prayer request, contact, Bible study sign-up, mentor request, community sign-up, Academy application and event registration. Paste each form's share link into *Site settings → Forms* (`content/site-settings.json`). An empty link hides its button.

## 16. Customize the DHL branding

- **Name, tagline, description, email:** `CONFIG` in `js/content.js`. Page titles and descriptions are written in each `.html` `<head>` so search engines can read them; update those with find-and-replace.
- **Logo:** the site uses `assets/logo/dhl-logo.png` (256 × 256, transparent background). Browser icons are `assets/icons/favicon-32.png` and `favicon-192.png`, and the phone home-screen icon is `apple-touch-icon.png` (180 × 180, white background). Your original logo file is kept as `assets/logo/dhl-logo-original.svg`; it isn't loaded by the site because it's 1 MB. To change the logo, replace these PNG files with the same names and sizes, or set `CONFIG.logo`.
- **Sharing image:** replace `assets/images/og-image.png` (1200 × 630).
- **Colors:** edit the variables at the top of `css/style.css`. `--navy` is the main color, `--mango` the action color, and `--teal`, `--red`, `--blue` the pathway line colors.
- **Fonts:** Sora (headings) and Noto Sans / Noto Sans KR (body, including Korean text), from Google Fonts.
- **Verse of the day:** edit *Verse of the day* in Pages CMS (`content/daily-verses.json`). One verse shows per day, in order, based on the visitor's date. The text is King James Version (public domain). If you switch to a modern translation such as the NIV, check its copyright permissions for websites first and change `dailyVerseVersion`.
- **Section photos:** each learning page has a photo beside its title, and the same photos appear on the category and program cards. Save your photos in `assets/images/` with these exact names:

  | File name | Where it appears |
  |---|---|
  | `contents.jpg` | Contents Hub |
  | `bible-journey.jpg` | Bible Journey page and its category card |
  | `gospel-class.jpg` | Gospel Class page and its program card |
  | `discipleship.jpg` | Discipleship Training page and its program card |
  | `mind-education.jpg` | Mind Education page and its program card |
  | `live-in-korea.jpg` | Live in Korea page and its category card |
  | `certificates.jpg` | Certificate Courses page and its category card |

  Use landscape photos, about 1200 × 800 pixels and under 400 KB each. Until a photo is added, a designed placeholder in the section's color is shown, so nothing looks broken. After adding a photo, update its `alt` description in `CONFIG.photos` (`js/content.js`) so screen-reader users know what it shows. To use a different file name, change `src` there.
- **Community photo (top of the home page):** save a photo of your community as `assets/images/community.jpg` (landscape, about 1600 × 900 pixels, under 500 KB so it loads quickly on phones). It appears behind the top of the home page with a navy tint so the text stays readable, and it's also the picture on the pinned "Welcome to DHL" post. Until the file exists, the plain navy background and a placeholder picture are shown. To use a different file name, change `heroImage` in `CONFIG`. If faces get cut off, set `heroImagePosition` to `"top"` or, for example, `"center 30%"`. Only use photos you have permission to publish, and ask people before posting pictures where they can be recognized.
- **Bible links:** `CONFIG.bibleVersion` sets which version BibleGateway opens (for example `"NIV"`, `"ESV"` or `"KJV"`).

## 18. News Admin: publish news from a form

`admin.html` lets DHL administrators write a post, preview it, and publish it to the website without editing `content/posts.json` by hand. (Pages CMS, section 19, can also do this without any server. The News Admin is optional.)

```
admin.html ──"Sign in with GitHub"──▶ News Admin Worker ──▶ GitHub sign-in (identity only)
           ◀── signed 8-hour session ──   (only usernames in ADMIN_USERS)

admin.html ──new post + session──▶ Worker ──GitHub token (server-side secret)──▶ GitHub API
                                          adds the post to content/posts.json ──▶ GitHub Pages rebuilds
```

### Why a Worker is needed

GitHub Pages only serves files. Anything in them, including JavaScript, can be read by anyone. Writing to your repository needs a GitHub token, and a token in the website would let anyone change your site. So the token is kept in a small free Cloudflare Worker, and the admin page only ever talks to the Worker.

### Files

**Added**
- `admin.html`: the News Admin page. It isn't in the menu and is hidden from search engines (`noindex` and `robots.txt`). Hiding it isn't the protection, though: the page is harmless without a signed-in session.
- `js/admin.js`: sign-in, the form, validation, live preview, draft saving and publishing.
- `news.html`: all news, or one full article with `news.html?id=...`.
- `backend-example/news-admin-worker/worker.js` and `wrangler.toml`: the secure publishing service.

**Modified**
- `content/posts.json`: the post format is unchanged. Optional `id`, `content`, `author`, `scripture` and `scriptureVersion` fields support full articles.
- `js/main.js`: posts with `id` and `content` now link to their article page, which has new article rendering. The News page is added to the menu.
- `js/content.js`: new setting `CONFIG.admin.endpoint`.
- `js/ai-chat.js`: no "Ask DHL AI" button on the admin page.
- CSS files, `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.

### How sign-in works

1. The admin clicks **Sign in with GitHub**. The Worker sends them to GitHub, which asks them to approve "DHL News Admin". The app only asks to read their public profile.
2. GitHub sends them back to the Worker with a one-time code. The Worker checks a random `state` value to block forged logins, and swaps the code for the admin's GitHub username.
3. If the username is in `ADMIN_USERS`, the Worker creates a **session**, signed with `SESSION_SECRET`, that expires after 8 hours. Anyone else gets "This account isn't on the News Admin list."
4. The session is kept in the browser tab (`sessionStorage`) and cleared when the tab closes or the admin clicks **Sign out**. It can't be forged or changed, because the Worker checks the signature on every request.

The admin's own GitHub token is used only to learn their username, then thrown away. It never reaches the browser.

### How publishing works

1. `admin.js` checks the form and sends the post to the Worker, along with the session.
2. The Worker checks the session and validates every field again. Dates must be real `YYYY-MM-DD` dates, links must be `https://` or a page on the site, and `javascript:` links are refused.
3. It reads `content/posts.json` from GitHub and adds the new post at the top of the `posts` list, with the same fields as the existing posts. It gives the post a unique `id` based on the date and title. All other posts are kept exactly as they were. If the file isn't valid JSON, it stops and changes nothing.
4. It commits the change as "News: *post title*", with the admin as author. If the file changed in the meantime, it re-reads the file and tries again, so nothing is overwritten.
5. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically after the commit, usually within 1–2 minutes.

### Setup (about 30 minutes, once)

You need a GitHub account, a free Cloudflare account and Node.js (LTS, from nodejs.org).

**Step 1. Create the GitHub token** (lets the Worker update the posts file)
1. On GitHub: your photo → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Fine-grained tokens** → **Generate new token**.
2. Name: `DHL News Admin`. Expiration: the longest allowed. Put a reminder in your calendar to renew it.
3. **Repository access:** *Only select repositories*, then choose your DHL website repository.
4. **Permissions → Repository permissions → Contents:** *Read and write*. Leave everything else as it is.
5. Click **Generate token** and copy it. You'll only see it once.

**Step 2. Set up and deploy the Worker**
1. Open a terminal in `backend-example/news-admin-worker`.
2. Edit `wrangler.toml`:
   - `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO`: from your repository address `github.com/OWNER/REPO`
   - `GITHUB_BRANCH`: usually `main`
   - `ADMIN_PAGE_URL`: e.g. `https://www.diasporahubforleaders.com/admin.html`
   - `ADMIN_USERS`: GitHub usernames allowed to publish, comma-separated
   - `POSTS_PATH`: leave as `content/posts.json`
3. Run:
   ```
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```
   Note the address it prints, e.g. `https://dhl-news-admin.your-account.workers.dev`.

**Step 3. Create the GitHub sign-in app**
1. On GitHub: **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**.
2. Application name: `DHL News Admin`. Homepage URL: your website address.
3. **Authorization callback URL:** your Worker address + `/auth/callback`, e.g. `https://dhl-news-admin.your-account.workers.dev/auth/callback`.
4. Click **Register application**. Copy the **Client ID** into `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` in `wrangler.toml`.
5. Click **Generate a new client secret** and copy it.

**Step 4. Store the secrets in Cloudflare** (never in any file)
```
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET
npx wrangler deploy
```
Paste the token from step 1, the client secret from step 3, and for `SESSION_SECRET` a long random text of at least 32 characters (a password manager can generate one).

**Step 5. Connect the website**
In `js/content.js`, set:
```js
admin: { endpoint: "https://dhl-news-admin.your-account.workers.dev" },
```
Commit the change. The Worker address isn't secret.

### Creating your first post

1. Open `https://www.diasporahubforleaders.com/admin.html` (bookmark it).
2. Click **Sign in with GitHub**, then **Authorize** (the first time only).
3. Fill in the title, date, post type, category and short description. Then write the full content, or add an external link.
4. Check the preview on the right, then click **Publish post**.
5. You'll see "Post published successfully!" Wait 1–2 minutes, then click **View the post**.

Your unfinished text is saved on your device as you type. If your session expires, sign in again and your draft is still there.

To **edit or delete** a published post, use Pages CMS (section 19).

### Managing access
- **Add or remove an admin:** edit `ADMIN_USERS` in `wrangler.toml` and run `npx wrangler deploy`. Removed admins are signed out immediately.
- **Sign everyone out:** set a new `SESSION_SECRET`.
- **If the GitHub token leaks or expires:** delete it on GitHub, create a new one (step 1), and run `npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN` again.
- **Cost:** Cloudflare Workers' free plan and GitHub are enough for this. Check Cloudflare's current free-plan limits.

### Troubleshooting

| Message | What to do |
|---|---|
| "The News Admin isn't connected yet" | Set `CONFIG.admin.endpoint` (step 5). |
| "Couldn't reach the News Admin service" | Check the address in `CONFIG.admin.endpoint`, and that `ADMIN_PAGE_URL` in `wrangler.toml` matches your site exactly. |
| "…isn't on the News Admin list" | Add that GitHub username to `ADMIN_USERS` and redeploy. |
| "GitHub token was refused" | The token expired or lacks *Contents: Read and write* on this repository. Create a new one. |
| "GitHub couldn't find content/posts.json" | Check `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_BRANCH` and `POSTS_PATH`. |
| GitHub sign-in shows "redirect_uri mismatch" | The OAuth App's callback URL must be the Worker address + `/auth/callback`. |
| Published, but not on the site yet | Wait a few minutes. GitHub Pages is rebuilding. |

### Adding image uploads later

This first version takes an image link. To upload photos directly:
1. In `admin.js`, let the admin pick a photo. Shrink it in the browser (for example to 1600 px wide as a JPEG) using a canvas, and send it to the Worker as base64 together with the post.
2. In the Worker, add a route such as `POST /api/images`. It checks the session, checks the file really is a JPEG, PNG or WebP under about 1 MB, gives it a safe name like `assets/images/news/2026-10-05-bible-camp.jpg`, and uploads it with the same GitHub contents API (`PUT /contents/<path>`).
3. Return the new path to the form and fill in **Featured image URL** automatically.

The same token and session protect uploads, so no new secrets are needed.


## 19. Edit everything with Pages CMS (free)

[Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) is a free, open-source editor for websites stored on GitHub. It reads `.pages.yml` in this project and shows a simple form for each part of the site: news, events, Gospel topics, courses, quizzes, Live in Korea guides, Q&A, verses and settings. When you click **Save**, it saves the change to your GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages updates the site within a minute or two.

No server, database or secret keys are needed. You sign in with GitHub, and only people with access to your repository can edit.

### First-time setup (5 minutes)
1. Upload the website to GitHub first (section 20).
2. Go to **app.pagescms.org** and click **Sign in with GitHub**.
3. When asked, **install the Pages CMS GitHub app** and give it access to your DHL repository only.
4. Open your repository in Pages CMS. The sections from `.pages.yml` appear in the menu on the left.

### Editing
- **Change something:** open a section (for example *Gospel Class: topics*), open an item, edit the fields, and click **Save**.
- **Add something:** open the section and click **Add an entry**. Lists inside items, such as Bible references, tips, quiz options and lessons, have their own add buttons.
- **Remove something:** use the item's remove (trash) button, then **Save**.
- **Reorder:** drag items in a list.
- **AI answers:** open *AI assistant: knowledge* to add questions and the answers DHL AI should give (section 12).
- **Page titles and headings:** open *Page titles & headings*, then a page, and change its title, introduction or section headings. Leave a field empty to go back to the original text.
- **Lectures:** open *Lectures*. Add, edit or remove **categories** (name, description, photo), and inside each category add **lectures**. A lecture can have a YouTube link (the video plays on the page), full text, an MP3 recording, and files such as PowerPoint slides, PDFs or Word handouts. Upload files under about 20 MB. For bigger files, put them on Google Drive and paste the link. On the website, PowerPoint and Word files get a **View online** button (Microsoft's free viewer), and PDFs are shown right on the page. Lecture pages have addresses like `lectures.html?c=mind-education&l=heart-1`, so don't change an ID after sharing a link.
- **Mentors:** open *Mentors* to add, edit or remove mentor profiles: photo, role, languages, areas, credentials, a short bio, and contact links (KakaoTalk open chat link or ID, Messenger link, Gmail address). Untick *Show this mentor* to hide a profile. Every "Talk to a mentor" button on the site opens the Mentors page (`mentors.html`). Only publish photos and contact details with each mentor's permission, and only list real credentials.
- **Bible Journey programs and their courses:** open *Bible Journey: pathway & programs*. Under each program (Gospel Class, Discipleship Training, Mind Education), add or remove certificate course IDs, for example `gospel-foundations`. The courses appear on the program card, on the Bible Journey page and on the program's own page. Keep the program IDs `gospel`, `discipleship` and `mind`. The pathway steps (Gospel → Discipleship → Leadership → Ministry) are edited here too. Mind Education has its own section on the Bible Journey page, alongside the pathway.
- **Photos:** in an image field, upload a photo. It's saved in `assets/images/`. Use landscape photos under about 400 KB.
- **Wait 1–2 minutes** after saving, then refresh the website.

### Letting others edit
Invite them to your GitHub repository as collaborators (on GitHub: **Settings → Collaborators → Add people**). They can then sign in to Pages CMS with their own GitHub account. Remove them the same way.

### Good to know
- Every save is recorded in GitHub's history, so any change can be undone: on GitHub, open the file → **History** → pick an older version.
- Page structure (the menu, pathways, journey steps and category cards) and technical settings (YouTube key, AI, photos for sections) are in `js/content.js`, which you change rarely. Edit it on GitHub or ask a developer.
- Pages CMS is free at the time of writing. If its configuration format changes in future, check the documentation at pagescms.org. The content files are plain JSON, so you're never locked in.
- Uploaded files from the *Downloads* field also go to `assets/images/`. The existing download templates stay in `assets/downloads/`.

## 20. Uploading the website to GitHub, step by step

Everything here is free.

### A. Create your account and repository
1. Create a free account at **github.com**.
2. Click **+** (top right) → **New repository**. Name it, for example `dhl`. Choose **Public** (GitHub Pages is free for public repositories). Don't add a README. Click **Create repository**.

### B. Upload the files with GitHub Desktop (recommended)
The project has more than 100 files, and GitHub's web uploader accepts at most 100 files at a time, so the free **GitHub Desktop** app is the easiest way.
1. Install **GitHub Desktop** from desktop.github.com and sign in.
2. **File → Clone repository**, choose your new repository, and pick a folder on your computer.
3. Unzip the DHL project and copy **everything inside it** into that folder, including the hidden `.pages.yml` and `.nojekyll` files. On Windows, turn on *View → Hidden items*; on Mac, press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder.
4. Back in GitHub Desktop, type a summary such as "Upload DHL website" and click **Commit to main**, then **Push origin**.

**Without GitHub Desktop:** on your repository page, click **Add file → Upload files** and drag in the folders a few at a time (under 100 files per upload), clicking **Commit changes** after each.

### C. Turn on the website
Repository → **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch**, Branch: **main**, folder **/ (root)** → **Save**. After a minute or two, the site is online. Then connect your domain (section 5, *Your domain*).

### D. Updating later
- **Content:** use Pages CMS (section 19).
- **A new version of the whole project** (for example after I send you an updated zip): copy the new files into your GitHub Desktop folder, replacing the old ones, then **Commit** and **Push**. Your content edits live in `content/`. Before replacing that folder, make sure your latest content is included, or copy only the files that changed.


## 21. Member accounts and members-only lectures

Log in, sign up and members-only lectures are provided by a small PHP + MySQL service on Namecheap Stellar at `members.diasporahubforleaders.com`. The code and a step-by-step setup guide are in `backend-php/` (see `backend-php/README.md`).

- While **Site settings → Members service address** is empty, the website works exactly as before, with no login.
- When it's set, the header shows **Log in**. Members-only lectures (added in the admin panel) appear on the Lectures page with a 🔒 badge, and `account.html` handles log in, sign-up, forgot password and account deletion.
- There are two kinds of accounts: **members** (anyone who signs up) and **students** (members you enroll). Students can open students-only lectures and do **tasks**: assignments, quizzes (marked automatically) and discussions. A task's button sits next to the lecture's Download buttons, and you review responses in the admin panel. Members' Office files also get **View online**. See `backend-php/README.md`.
- `privacy.html` is the privacy policy linked from the sign-up form and the footer.

The `backend-php/` folder doesn't need to be on GitHub: it runs on Namecheap. It contains no passwords (those go in `config.php` on the server only).
